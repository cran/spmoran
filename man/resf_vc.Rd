\description{
This model estimates regression coefficients, spatially varying coefficients (SVCs), non-spatially varying coefficients (NVC; coefficients varying with respect to explanatory variable value), SNVC (= SVC + NVC), group effects, and residual spatial dependence. The random-effects eigenvector spatial filtering, which is an approximate Gaussian process approach, is used for modeling the spatial process in coefficients and residuals. While the resf_vc function estimates a SVC model by default, the type of coefficients (constant, SVC, NVC, or SNVC) can be selected through a BIC/AIC minimization. The explained variables are transformed to fit the data distribution if nongauss is specified. Thus, this function is available for modeling Gaussian and non-Gaussian continuous data and count data (see \code{\link{nongauss_y}}).

Note 1: SNVCs can be mapped just like SVCs. SNVC model is more robust against spurious correlation (multicollinearity) and stable than SVC models (see Murakami and Griffith, 2020).

Note 2: The SVC model can be less accurate for large samples due to a degeneracy/over-smoothing problem (see Murakami et al., 2023). The \code{\link{addlearn_local}} is useful to mitigate this problem (See the coding example below).
